<b>The new create page</b>
All the information about a retro is displayed in one place. Select the retro type you'd like, and select the template to view more details so you can find the perfect retro for what you need right now.

The current stages have been removed from the toolbar for a more UX focused and streamlined toolbar.

Stages have been moved from the toolbar to the heading, you can view the last stages, and see the current stage and the timer all in one place.
